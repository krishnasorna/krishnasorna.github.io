         <h1>Srikrishna Sorna</h1>
         <p>Hello! I am currently the CEO of Student Holdings and a student at Northwestern University.</p>
         <p>Student Holdings is a non-profit charity established in the United States under the US IRS Code Section 501(c)(3).</p>
         <p>My goals are to become a SWE at innovative companies and establish new inventions.</p>
         <p>One fun fact about me is that I was born in India but have lived in the US since I was 6 years old.</p>
         <p>I have always had a passion for the intersection of business and technology and would love to work for a compnay in the future that works closely with business technology such as IBM.</p>
         <p>Currently, I am looking for internships in the technlogy sector around the country to gain real world experience in coding and artifical intelligence applications.</p>
         <p>Taking this Human Computer Interaction course has helped me realize the value of robotics in everyday lifestyle for individuals and how we can incorporate good principles in web design as well.</p>
         <p>I am a member of IEEE, Student Holdings, and for fun I participate in a non-competitive dance team at Northwestern University.</p>
